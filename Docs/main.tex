        \section{INTRODUCTION}
            \textit{The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)}, also known as \textit{Rijndael} is a specification for encrypting electronic data first introduced by the \textit{U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)} in 2001. It provides a fast and secure way to encrypt data and uses symmetric keys encryption which means both the encryption and decryption processes using the same key. The key length for AES could be 128, 192 and 256 bits. This paper concentrates on AES using 256-bit key which will be refered to as AES-256 for the rest of this paper.

        \section{AES-256}
            \subsection{Key Expansion}
                The Key Expansion routine in AES-256 takes a 256-bit cipher key and generate a set of $Nb(Nr+1)$ (which is 60) words. These words are smaller parts that make up round keys, each round key has four words. These round keys involve in the \textit{Add Round Key} in the encryption and decryption process.

                There are 3 functions that participate in the key scheduling process:

            \subsubsection{Algorithm}
                In AES-256, the first two round keys (first 8 words) are filled with the cipher key. For the rest, $w[i]$ word is generated using $w[i-1]$ word.

                Loop through the following steps until we have generated $Nb(Nr+1)$ words.

                If $i$ is divisible by \textbf{\textit{Nk}}, $w[i-1]$ is rotated by the function \textbf{\textit{RotWord}} and then substituted by the function \textbf{\textit{SubWord}}. The final result is \textbf{\textit{XOR}}-ed with \textbf{\textit{Rcon[i/Nk]}} and assigned to $w[i]$. Otherwise, if $i$ dividing by \textbf{\textit{Nk}} results in $4$ as the remainder, only \textbf{\textit{SubWord}} is performed on $w[i-1]$.

                $w[i]$ will then be \textbf{\textit{XOR}}-ed with $w[i-Nk]$ and the result is assigned back to itself. $i$ is incremented by 1.

                After finishing the algorithm, a set of $Nb(Nr+1)$ words is generated. Round Keys are created by grouping four words each sequentially. At this point, we have one round key for the initial round and 14 round keys for 14 rounds during the encryption or decryption processes, with the total of 15 round keys.

            \subsection{Bytes Substitution}

            Bytes Substitution transformation is denoted by \textit{SubBytes} function. This independently replaces all the bytes in the \textit{State} with the corresponding bytes using a \textit{substituion box} (or \textit{S-Box}), which is shown in the figure \ref{fig:SBox}.

            The higher 4 bits determine the coordinate of the row and lower 4 bits determine the coordinate of the column. For example, the byte \textbf{5A}, we have $x=5$ \& $y=A$, these values point to the new value in the table, which is \textbf{BE}. So \textbf{5A} will be substituted by \textbf{BE}.

            \subsection{Shift Rows}
            \label{sec:shift-rows-intro}

            In the \textit{ShiftRows} transformation, the last three row of the \textit{State} will be rotated to the left with different byte offsets.

            The first row of the \textit{State} is unaffected. The second row will be rotated to the left by one byte, two bytes for the third row, and three bytes for the fourth row. Therefore,
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    a_{0} & a_{4} & a_{8} & a_{12}\\
                    a_{1} & a_{5} & a_{9} & a_{13}\\
                    a_{2} & a_{6} & a_{10} & a_{14}\\
                    a_{3} & a_{7} & a_{11} & a_{15}
                \end{bmatrix}
            \end{equation}
            will become
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    a_{0} & a_{4} & a_{8} & a_{12}\\
                    a_{5} & a_{9} & a_{13} & a_{1}\\
                    a_{10} & a_{14} & a_{2} & a_{6}\\
                    a_{15} & a_{3} & a_{7} & a_{11}
                \end{bmatrix}
            \end{equation}
            after \textit{ShiftRows} transformation.

            \subsection{Mix Columns}

            \textit{MixColumns} transformation operates column-by-column on the \textit{State}. Each column is multiplied with a fixed matrix which results in a new column with new values.

            The fixed matrix used in \textit{MixColumns} is shown below:

            \begin{equation}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                02 & 03 & 01 & 01\\
                01 & 02 & 03 & 01\\
                01 & 01 & 02 & 03\\
                03 & 01 & 01 & 02
            \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}

            \subsection{Add Round Keys}

            Round Keys generated from \textit{Key Expansion} rountine will be used in this transformation. Round Key is added to the \textit{State} by a bitwise XOR operation with the corresponding bytes.

        \section{IMPLEMENTATION}

            \subsection{Key Expansion}

            The design of the Key Expansion routine is shown in figure \ref{fig:KeyExpansion}. As in the design, the total of 15 round keys, including round key for the initial round, will be created firstbefore they could involve in the \textbf{\textit{Add Round Key}} function in the encryption and decryption process.
            
            This circuit will generate words that make up the Round Key one-by-one and store them in the \textit{Register File}. The \textit{Register File} has the total amount of 64 registers but only 60 of them are used because we only need to generate 60 words. The module \textit{Rcon} and \textit{SubWord} are implemented in the form of look-up tables (LUTs).

            In order for the circuit to work, the \textit{reset} signal must be pulled low (the \textit{reset} signal is active low) and then the \textit{enable} signal is pulled high. The cipher key can be passed through \textit{Input Data}. After reset, the counter's value will be set to zero and increased by 1 after each clock cycle. In the meantime, the inputted cipher key will be broken up into words, which are 32 bits each, and stored in eight registers from $w_{0}$ to $w_{7}$.
            
            In the next eight clock cycles each of the word will be saved into the \textit{Register File} sequentially from the address 1 to 8. After that, to generate the $i^{th}$ word, $(i-1)^{th}$ and $(i-Nk)^{th}$ words are required, which can be accessed through Register File's Out\_A \& Out\_B ports respectively, with the addresses are selected by $i-1$ \& $i-8$ blocks in the circuit.
            
            Depend on which word is generating, \textit{RotWord}, \textit{SubWord} can all be performed or just \textit{SubWord} is performed or neither of those. This is controlled by signals from \textit{mod 9 = 4} \& \textit{mod 9 = 0} blocks. Basically, the \textit{mod 9 = 4} block checks if a input number dividing by 9 has 4 as the remainder. If it is, the output will be pulled high and pulled low if it is not. Same thing with the \textit{mod 9 = 0} block but with 0 as the remainder. The design of \textit{mod 9 = 0} \& \textit{mod 9 = 4} are shown in figure \ref{fig:mod9eq0} \& figure \ref{fig:mod9eq4}, respectively.
            
            \noindent
            \begin{Figure}
                \centering

                \label{fig:mod9eq4}
            \end{Figure}

            All the words will have been generated after sixty-one clock cycles. The counter will shut it self and the \textit{ready} signal is set indicating all round keys have been generated. After done generating and the \textit{ready} signal is set, round keys can be accessed by inputting the appropriate address through \textit{Key Address} input, which have the value range from 0 to 14.

            \subsection{Bytes Substitution}

            \noindent
            \begin{Figure}
                \centering

                \label{fig:subbytes}
            \end{Figure}

            The design for \textit{SubBytes} block is shown in figure \ref{fig:subbytes}. The \textit{SBox} used in this circuit is implemented as LUT and is the same as \textit{SBox} from figure \ref{fig:SBox} and \textit{SubWord} in \textit{Key Expansion} routine.

            This ciruit takes 128-bit data and splits into words and then into individual bytes. Each byte will be fed into \textit{SBox} and the corresponding byte will be outputted. The outputted bytes will then be combined into words and eventually into 128-bit output data.

            \subsection{Shift Rows}

            \noindent
            \begin{Figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ShiftRows.png}

                \label{fig:shiftrows}
            \end{Figure}

            The circuit diagram for \textit{ShiftRows} is shown in figure \ref{fig:shiftrows}. This circuit takes 128-bit data in, perform shifting and output 128-bit data.

            The inputted data will first be split into 32-bit words, note that each word corresponds to a column in the \textit{State}. The first row is formed by taking the first byte in each word, and the second byte in each word for the second row and so on for the third and fourth rows. After dividing the input into rows, the shifting operation is done by wiring each row with the corresponding offsets which discussed in section \ref{sec:shift-rows-intro}.

            Finally, all the rows will be split and combined into correct columns and rows format of the \textit{State}.
